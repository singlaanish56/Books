Lexical Analysis

`Source Code` -> `Tokens` -> `Abstract Syntax Tree`

Definition
```
lexical analysis or lexing is a form to convert the expression or the statements to one word to differentiate, scan and parse the given source code easily
```

these token when fed into the parser and transforms into Abstract Syntax Tree.

for eg.
let x = 5 + 5;

tokens
```
let
indentifier(x)
eqaul sign
integer(5)
plus sign
integer (5)
semicolon
```


how the token are implemented depends on the lexer or on the language,
 like python would consider the whitespace as significant lexer

on the other hand a lexer might even attach line number and column number to the token.
