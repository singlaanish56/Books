```
A parser takes the input and computes a data structure out of it, usually a hierarchical tree or a abstarct tree. Which helps give a structural representation to the input, as well verifying  the syntax in the process.

parse is preceded by a lexer, to tokenize  the initial input, into the acceptable token for the parser.
```

The commonly used DS is AST or an abtract syntax tree.
Parser does not immediately store all the information available from the token, it uses the brackets / semicolon / comments to define how to structure the AST



## Parser Generator


definition
```
given a grammer input, a parser generator, generates the source code to create the abstarct tree out of a given input of characters.
it also spits outs the code to do the tree walk and lexer code.
```

CFG, BNG, EBNF

CFG -> formal grammer used to define the syntax of the programming languages -> underlying concept of the notations
```
<expression> ::= <term> + <expression> 
				| <term> - <expression> 
				| <term> 
				
<term> ::= <factor> * <term> 
		  | <factor> / <term> 
		  | <factor> 
		  
<factor> ::= (Number) | ((<expression>))
```
BNF -> notation technique for context free grammer
```
<expression> ::= <term>
               | <term> "+" <expression>
               | <term> "-" <expression>

<term> ::= <factor>
         | <factor> "*" <term>
         | <factor> "/" <term>

<factor> ::= NUMBER
           | "(" <expression> ")"
```
EBNF -> extended BNF with more support
```
expression = term, {("+"|"-"), term};
term = factor, {("*"|"/"), factor};
factor = NUMBER | "(" , expression, ")";

(* Additional EBNF features *)
whitespace = " " | "\t" | "\n";
NUMBER = {"0".."9"}+;
```
