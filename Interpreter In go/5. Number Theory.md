# Check if a number is prime

why are there infinite prime numbers ?
```proof
let say we have a finite set of  prime numbers, P={p1, p2, p3, .....pn}.

we can contradict it by saying that 
i can construct a new number px = (p1*p2*p3...*pn)+1

this number is not divisible by any of the available primes in the set, which can mean two things

1. the px is prime itself
2. px has prime factors not part of the inital P set.

in both the cases the our initial assumption of limited prime factors is wrong
```

what does a non prime number mean
```proof
similarly every non prime number, should have atleast one prime factor p
where p <= sqaureroot(n)

why?
let say d | n ( n is divisible by d / d is a factor of n)

we can say
d.k=n

so either of the numbers, d or k has to be less than equal to swaureroot(n)
otherwise the multiplication will exceed n

```

We can use the above to find whether a number is prime or not

```c++
bool prime(int n){

if(n<2) return false;
for(int x=2;x*x<=n;x++){
	if(n%x==0) return false;
}
return true;

}
```

also, all the factors of a given number, eg 24 = [2,2,2,3]

```C++
vector<int> factors(int n){

vector<int> f;
for(int x=2;x*x<=n;x++){
	while(n%x==0){
		f.push_back(x);
		n/=x
	}
}

if(n>1) f.push_back(n);
return f;
}
```


# Sieve of Eratosthenes

this build a preprocessor array of a given size, which returns whether a number is prime or not, if not returns one of the factors of the number.

the time complexity for this is O(nlogn)
```C++
vector<int> sieve(int n){
vector<int> sieve(n+1, 0);

for(int x=2;x<=n;x++){
	if(sieve[x]) continue; // is the values is not zero, as in here, this number is not prime ans hence continue

	// if the number is prime, set all the multiples of the prime as not prime
	for(int u=2*x;u<=n;u+=x){
		sieve[u]=x;
	}
}

return sieve
}
```

# Euclid's Algorithm

this algo lets us effectively calculate the gcd(a,b)

it states that if 
1. b=0 ;     gcd(a,b) =a
2. b!=0;     gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a mod b)

seems odd, for eg

gcd(13, 8) = gcd(8, 5) = gcd(5, 3) = gcd(3, 2) = gcd(2, 1) = gcd(1, 0) = 1

Why?

```proof

let say d is the gcd(a, b),

we can represent a = k1 . d  and b = k2. d.
hence d will be a factor of any linear combination of a and b

eg
	m.a + n.b = m.k1.d+n.k2.d= d(m.k1 + n.k2)


Using this lets say we write a as a=bq+r (quotient and a remainder)

because d | a = d | (bq+r) 

and because d | b so  ---------->  d | r 

bq+r is linear combination of b and r.

replace the r in d | r

d | (a-bq).

which is nothing by remainder of a mod b

hence for b!=0 gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a mod b)

```

code
```C++
int gcd(a,b){
if(b==0) return a;

return gcd(b, a%b);
}
```

# Modular Exponentiation

How to effectively calculate the x^n  % m (or without m)

x^n =

1. n=0;  1
2. n is even; x^(n/2) * x^(n/2)
3. n is odd;  x^(n-1) * x

this should resolve the values in O(logn), because we are effectively halving the solutions

```C++
int modPow(int x, int n , int m){
if(n==0) return 1;

long long u = modPow(x,n/2,m);
u=(u*u)%m;

if(u%2==1) u=(u*x)%m;

return u
}
```

# Diophantine Equations

this help us find whether or not a solution exists for the given linear equations, and also find all the integer solutions

a.x + b.y = c


this build on the Euclid's Algorithm where 

a.x+b.y = gcd(a, b)

so we gcd(a, b) | c, we can say that the equation has solutions.

for eg,

39x+15y=12

gcd(39,15) = gcd(15, 9) = gcd(9, 6) = gcd(6, 3) = gcd(3, 0) = 3;

and 3 divides c(12) hence there exists some solutions


How to find the solutions

we have to use the Euclid's representation above to form the solutions

```proof
so lets say
for ax+by =c 

ax0+by0 = gcd(a,b)

for b!=0
gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a mod b)

bx1 + (a mod b) y1 = gcd(b, a mod b)

a mod b can represented as a -(a/b)b

so bx1 + (a- (a/b)b) y1 = gcd(a,b)
ay1 + b(x1 -(a/b)y1) = gcd(a,b)

x0 = y1
y0 = (x1 - (a/b)y1)

now if the solution is applicable the 
x= x0*(c/g)
y= y0*(c/g)


similarly to find all the solutions
(x,y) = ((xp + kb/g), (yp-ka/g))
```

coding this together
```C++

tuple<long long , long long , long long> gcd(long long a, long long b){
if(b==0){
return {a,1,0};
}

auto [g, x1, y1] = gcd(b, a%b);
long long x = y1;
long long y = x1-(a/b)*y1;
return {g,x,y};
}

bool findAllSolutions(long long a, long long b, long long c, vector<std:pair<long , long>>& solutions)
{
auto [ g ,x0, y0] = gcd(abs(a), abs(b));

if(c%g!=0) // no solutions available
	return false;

//scale to find the first solution
if(a<0) x0*=-1;
if(b<0) y0*=-1;

long long  scale = c/g;
long long xp= x0*scale;
long long yp= y0*scale;

long long range=1000000000000;
long long dx = b/g;
long long dy = a/g;


for(long long k=-range;k<=range;k++){
	long long x = xp + k.dx;
	long long y = yp + k.dy;
	solutions.push_back({x, y});
}

return true;

}
```
