# Eulerian Path
#eulerian

definition
```
Eulerian Path is a path goes exactly once through each edge of the graph
```

Eulerian Circuit
```
Eulerian Circuit is a eulerian path that starts and end at the same node
```

This is based off on the `Königsberg bridge problem`

![Pasted Image](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020241218014347.png)
It is a puzzle to be solved where, someone can visit every island without using  a bridge twice.

Very logical observation is that for to a person to visit an island and exit and move to another island, barring the starting and exit islands , we should have even number of bridge (or exit and enter the island).

So if we keep the island as a node and the bridge as an edge

For Undirected Graph

1. Degree of each node is even
2.  Or degree of exactly two node is odd and rest is even

For Directed Graph

1. Equally Number of Indegree or Outdegree
2. There is one node, where indegree > outdegree. But another degree, outdegree > indegree

## Hierholzer’s algorithm

This algorithm is an efficient way to finding the eulerian circuit / path with the use of dfs( for a directed graph)

For undirected graph we add and extra edge between the two extra odd nodes

the idea is to have an in /out node array to get the starting node or any starting node.

and then dfs till the node has an  out node, to dfs two, otherwise add the node to the front of the path array

```cpp
//n = vertices , m = edges, adj = adjancy list
//in[], out[], degree array
//path , list with the starting and the ending node
void countInOutDegree(){
	 for (edges in adj){
		 for (edge in edges){
			 out[edge[0]]++;
			 int[edge[1]]++;
		 }
	 }
}

//check the directed graph rules above
bool checkIfItHasEulerianPath(){
	int startNode, endNode=0;
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		if((out[i]-in[i])>1 || (in[i]-out[i])>1){
			return false;
		}
		if(out[i]-in[i]==1)
			startNode++;
		if(in[i]-out[i]==1)
			endNode++;
	}

	return (startNode==0 && endNode==0) || (startNode==1 && endNode==1);

}

//starting node with the more outdegree
int findTheStartingNode(){
int start=0;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
 if(out[i]-in[i]==1) return i;
if(out[i]>0) return i;
}

return start;
}

//dfs until the outdegree
void dfs(int node){

	while(out[node]!=0){
	dfs(adj[node].get(--out[node]));
	}
	path.appendFirst(node);
}


void findEulerianPath(){
countInOutDegree()
if not checkIfItHasEulerianPath() {
	return;
}

dfs(findTheStartingNode());
if path.size() == m+1{
	return path;
}

return nil
}
```

# Hamiltonian Path

definition
```
Hamiltonian Path is a path that goes through the node exactly once.
```

Similarly
```
if the start and the end node ends at the same node, it called a Haniltonian Circuit
```


there is no efficient way to test for Hamiltonian graph

```
A simple way to search for a Hamiltonian path is to use a backtracking algorithm that goes through all possible ways to construct the path. The time complexity of such an algorithm is at least O(n!), because there are n! different ways to choose the order of n nodes.
```
