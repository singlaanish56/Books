# Maximum Flow

definition
```
given a directed weighted graph, a source and snk node, find the maximum flow that can happen from the source to the sink

for each edge the maximum flow is the weight of the edge
source node only has outgoing nodes
sink node only has incoming nodes
```


## Ford Fulkerson Algo

this helps to find the maximum flow in a graph, it begins by selecting a path in each round, and reduce the weight of each edge equal to the minimum edge weight in the path.

the algo also maintains a reverse edge to the original node direction, whose weight is equal to weight deducted from the original node.
this helps identify we don't want to use a node, because we found a better path


Now the algo doesn't specify how to identify the path, which can be done using the following algos.

### Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

choose path that number of edges is the smallest, use the BFS instead of DFS, TC is O(m^2 n)

the idea is to maintain a map of the node and the parent that led them there, this helps to reiterate over the map and then calculate the minimum weight to deduct / what to add to the residual graph nodes ( the reverse nodes, we make a new graph with the reverse nodes graph as zero)

```cpp

//simple bfs to check whether or not the dest node is visited or not and the flow is greater than 0, we can actually travel to the node.
bool bfs(int[][] residualCapacity, map<int, int>& parent, int source, int sink){
	unordered_map<int, bool> visited;
	queue<int> q;
	q.push(parent);
	visited[source]=true;
	bool found=true;
	while(!q.empty()){
		int node = q.front();
		q.pop();
		for(int dest=0;dest<residualCapacity.size();dest++){
		
			if(visited.find(dest)==visited.end() && residualCapacity[node][dest]>0){
				parent[node]=dest;
				visited[dest]=true;
				q.push(dest);
				if(dest==sink){
					return true;
				}
			}
		
		}
	}

	return false;

}


int maxFlow(int[][] capacity, int source, int sink){
	int maxFlow=0;
	int n = capacity.length();
	int m = capacity[0].lenght();
	int[][] residualCapacity = new int[n][m];
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		for(int j=0;j<m;j++){
			residualCapacity[i][j]=capacity[i][j];
		}
	}
	map<int,int> parent;
	vector<vector<int>> augmentedPaths;

	while(bfs(residualCapacity, parent, source, sink)){
	vector<int> path;
	int flow=INT_MAX;

	int start=sink;
	//construc the path by backtracking, also track the minimum flow during this
	while(start != source){
			
		path.push_back(start);
		int parentNode = parent[start];
		if(flow > residualCapacity[parentNode][start]){
			flow=residualCapacity[parentNode][start];
		}
		start=parentNode;
	}
	path.push_back(start);
	reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
	augmentedPaths.push_back(path);
	
	start=sink;
	//change the exisitng weight for the edge according to the
	//flow found above
	while(start!=source){
		
		residualCapacity[parent[start]][start]-=flow;
		residualCapacity[start][parent[start]]+=flow;
		start=parent[start];
	}

	//flow for every path is the total path
	maxFlow+=flow;

	}

	return maxFlow;
}
```


### Scaling Algo 

uses DFS , but only select the path whose edge weight is less than the threshold. The threshold starts at sum of weight of all the edges in the graph, and is reduced by 1/2 in each iteration. TC O(m^2 logc)

similar to the previous implementation

```cpp

int dfs(int [][]residual, int source, int sink , vector<bool>& visited, int threshold, int flow){
	if(source==sink) return flow;
	visited[source]=true;

	for(int dest=0;dest<residual.size();dest++){
		
		if(!visited[dest] && residual[source][dest] >= threshold){
			int bottleneck = dfs(residual , dest, sink , visited, threshold min(residual[source][dest], flow))


			if(bottleneck>0){
				residual[source][dest]-=bottleneck;
				residual[dest][source]+=bottleneck;
			}
		}
	
	}

	return 0;
}
int maxFlow(int[][] capacity, int source , int sink){
	int maxcapacity=0;
	int n = capacity.length();
	int m = capacity[0].lenght();
	int[][] residualCapacity = new int[n][m];
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		for(int j=0;j<m;j++){
			maxcapacity=max(maxcapacity, capacity[i][j]);
			residualCapacity[i][j]=capacity[i][j];
		}
	}

	int scaling=1;
	while(scaling <= maxcapacity){
		scaling*=2;
	}
	scaling/=2;
	int maxFlow=0;
	while(scaling>0){
		vector<int> visited(n, false);
		int flow=0;
		while(flow=dfs(residual,source, sink,visited, scaling, INT_MAX)>0){
			maxFlow=flow;
			fill(visited.begin(), visited.end(), false);
		}
	}
}
```



# Minimum Cut

definition

```
minimum cut is defined as the minimum sum of the weighted edges to remove, such that source and never reach the sink
```


in a system minimum cut = maximum flow,

a cut is a partition of the graph into two disjoint sets
such that the capacity of the cut, is the sum of the edges connecting the two sets


so when all augmented paths are found for the graph, this condition is satisfied that the source cannot reach the sink,

so there might exist a cut where the min capacity at the node can be zero, or they could be their maxCapacity for the edge
