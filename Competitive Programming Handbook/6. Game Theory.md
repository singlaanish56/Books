the goal is to find a strategy that we can follow to win a game

there is two game states to maintain -> winning / losing state

## Nim game

in this game  one has n heaps with sticks, the game is that whoever picks up the last stick wins the game. You can win any no of sticks from any game.

### The strategy

we use the xor of the number of the sticks called nim sum

Two States 
`Losing State`, the final state is losing [0,0,0....0] so the nim sum is 0.
So if you leave your opponent with a nim sum 0, they have to choose a sticks, which will make your turn have a non zero xor sum

`Winning State` this is a non zero nim sum, where the player can force the sum to go zero, and hence higher chance of winning

for eg [10,12,5]

nim sum = 3
Player 1 chooses 10, because removing i stick from 10 = 9
9 xor 12 xor 5 = 0

in this way the player 1 would always have something to choose from, a non zero nim xor would mean there is atleast one heap with some sticks

### Misere game

Similar to the nim game , here the player loses if they pick the last stick.

The strategy remains same as nim game, until you start seeing the 1 stick heaps.
the idea is to maintain an odd no of 1 stick heaps after your turn , using the higher heaps to your advantage.

## Sprague-Grundy Theorem

This build up from the nim game, where it helps us compute the current state of the game whether we are losing or winning by computing the sub games that might be created by all the possible moves from this state

the idea is dependent on mex ( minimum exclusion), minimum number not part of the set.

Why does it help us ? earlier in the nim game the idea is to force the opponent to zero xor state. hence the if mex=0 it tells us that we in no moves we can force our opponent to zero and the current state is the losing state

the transitions states are winning positions for the opponent, a non zero mex would mean there exists atleast one transition where  the state is 0 and hence the opponent is losing

formula for single heap game
```
grundy(x)= mex{grundy(x1),........grundy)xn}

where the x1->xn are the possible states from x
```
formula for composite games, multiple heaps , sub games
```
result(current state = x) = xor(grundy(x1), grundy(x2)...., grundy(xn));

where x1->xn is all the intial positions

the grundy(xi) = mex{xi1, xi2...xin}, the states from xi


if the result(x)!=0 the current state is the winning state and we can force the opponent to a zero state.
