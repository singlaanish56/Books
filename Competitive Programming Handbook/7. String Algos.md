Useful Thing need for Strings

substring , subsequence, prefix, suffix, rotation, period(prefix when repeated constructs the strings), border(a string which is both prefix and suffix of a string).

# Trie Structure

this maintains a set of characters for each node , sort of a tree representation of a string(s), which helps compute prefixes/ suffixes in O(n), we can also store other information like if a word ends at a particular node.

the complexity of constructing a trie would be O(N x L) number of string  average length

# String Hashing

as hashing works, we can pre compute the hashes of the substring which helps match the pattern , prefix and suffix

we can use something like a polynomial hashing

```
hash(s) = (s[0] + s[1] . p + s[2]. p^2 + ...... + s[n-1] . p ^n-1) mod m
```

p and m are positive integers, m should be large enough for no collisions. 
But as you increase the number of comparisons with string the collisions probability increase as well/ 

for m ~ 1e9+9

for eg 1 comparison is 10^-9 , but as we increase the comparisons for 10^9 comparisons we hit 1 collision probability.

So one way to deal with this is to have two different hashes (two p's and two m's)
so together we have m ~ 10 ^ 18 , this makes the hash collision probability for the 10^6 comparisons to 10&-9

for the value of p is prime number  >= number of characters in the string. eg. only lowercase should be 31

compute the hash

```cpp
long long computeHash(string& s){
const int p =31;
const int m = 1e9+9;
long long hashValue = 0;
long long pp  = 1;

for(char c : s){
hashValue =(hashValue + (c-'a'+1) * pp) %m;
pp = (pp*p)%m;
}

return hashValue;

}
```

# Robin Karp Algo

this helps us find string s within the text t, two things
1/ we use the prefix and hash computation
2/ in the last if condition for h_s x ppow[i], to shift the h_s because it starts with p^0
but the substring in T starts with p^k;

```cpp
vector<int> rabin_karp(const string& s, const string& t){
const int p =31;
const int m = 1e9+9;
int ss = s.size(), ts = t.size();

vector<long long> ppow(max(s, t));
ppow[0]=1;
for(int i=1;i<ppow.size();i++){
ppow[i] = (ppow[i-1] * p) % m ;
}

vector<long long> hashT(T+1, 0);
for(int i=0;i<tm;i++){
	h[i+1] = (h[i] + (t[i]-'a'+1)*ppow[i])%m;
}

long long h_s=0;
for(int i=0;i<ss;i++){
h_s = (h_s + (s[i]-'a'+1) * ppow[i]) % m ;
}

vector<int> occurences;
for(int i=0;i+ss-1<ts;i++){
long long curr_h = (h[i+ss] - h[i] + m) %m;
//shift the h_s for the t substring
if(curr_h == h_s*ppow[i]*m){
occurences.push_back(i);
}
}

return occurences;
}

```

# KMP Algorithm

this algorithm helps compute the longest substring at a given index 
where prefix == suffix

this has to done is linear time, the function array can later be used to compute other things as well

what is the intuition behind it?

the naive solution is to match two indexes in the same string and whenever the condition breaks we start again. which can be the order of O(n^3)

the idea is that when the condition breaks, as in the first picture. we don't have to
match again starting from index 1 
the idea is that we know the longest matching suffix / prefix at the previous index, so we start at the index (image 2)

for eg in this case there is mismatch at index 5, we the longest prefix of previous index is 2 so we start at index 2 or i

build the prefix function array

```cpp
vector<int> prefixFunction(string& s){
	int n = s.size();
	vector<int> pi(n, 0);
	int j=0;
	for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
		if(s[i]==s[j]){
			pi[i]=p[i-1]+1; // if there is match add another char to previous match length
			j++; // move onto next index if we match (j is lagging index)
		}else{
			if(j!=0){
				j= pi[j-1]; // go the previous matched length
			}
			else{
				pi[i]=0; // no more previous start fresh;
			}
		}
		
	}
}
```

application -> find the number of occurrences of a pattern in a given string

```cpp
int kmpsearch(string& text, string& pattern){
	int n = text.size();
	int m = pattern.size();
	vector<int> pi = prefixFunction(pattern);
	int ans;
	int i=0,j=0;
	while(i<n-m+1){
		if(text[i]==pattern[j]){
			j++; i++;
		}else{
			if(j!=0) j= pi[j-1];
			else i++;
		}


		if(j==m){
			ans++;
			j=pi[j-1];
		}
	}
return ans;
}
```

# Z- Algorithm

is a way to find all the substrings of a string that are also prefixes.
for a given index i , z[i] is the longest substring starting at position i , that is also the prefix of the string.

trivial O(n^2)
```cpp
vector<int> z_function(string& s){
	int n = s.size();
	vector<int> z(n,0);
	for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
		// the s[z[i]] is the prefix, i+z[i] the substring starting i
		while(i+z[i]<n && s[z[i]]==s[i+z[i]]){
			z[i]++;
		}
	}

	return z;
}
```

Improving the time 

this idea depends on not precomputing the already matched items, and the concept of a window or a z-box. this window [L,R] this is the rightmost matched substring

so there are two ways the current index lies between the [L,R] the we can use the already existing values.
if i lied outside the  [L,R] we have to use the trivial method to compute the new range

```cpp
vector<int> z_function(string& s){
int n = s.size();
vector<int> z(n, 0);
int l=0,r=0;
for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
	if(i>r){
		//exapnd the r until it matches
		while(r<n && s[r-l]==s[r]) r++;
		z[i]=r-l;
		r--;
	}else{
		// this is the relative posiion of i in the prefix string
		int k = i-l;
		// the remaining length of the prefix is less than the length of left window. which means that it be same as z[k]
		if(z[k] < r-i+1){
			z[i]=z[k];
		}else{
			// use the trivial algo to compute
			l=i;
			while(r<n && s[r-l] == s[r]) r++;
			z[i]=r-l;
			r--;		
		}
	}
}
	return z;
}
```
